📌 Project Title

Data Preprocessing for Efficient Data Analysis and Machine Learning

📖 Project Description

This project focuses on implementing essential data preprocessing techniques required to transform raw and unstructured data into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format. Real-world datasets often contain missing values, inconsistencies, noise, and redundant information, which can negatively impact analytical results and machine learning models.

The project demonstrates preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization, scaling, and feature preparation using Python and standard data science libraries. This repository is intended for academic learning, practical understanding, and as a foundational project in data science and machine learning workflows.
